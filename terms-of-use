            <p><strong>4. Account Registration and Security. </strong>To use the Services,<strong> </strong>you understand that you will need to create an account to have access. You will: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service’s registration or subscription page (such information being the &quot;Registration Data&quot;) and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Organization has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Organization has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof). You are entirely responsible for the security and confidentiality of your password and account. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You will not share your account information or your user name and password with any third party or permit any third party to log on to the Service using your account information. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account or any other security breach of which you become aware. You are responsible for taking precautions and providing security measures best suited for your situation and intended use of the Service. We have the right to provide user billing, account, Content or use records, and related information under certain circumstances (such as in response to legal responsibility, lawful process, orders, subpoenas, or warrants, or to protect our rights, customers or business) to third parties. Please note that anyone able to provide your personally identifiable information will be able to access your account so you should take reasonable steps to protect this information.</p>
            <p><strong>5. Termination. </strong>You or we may suspend or terminate your account used within Services at any time, for any reason or for no reason. You are personally liable for any orders placed or charges incurred through your account prior to termination. We may also block your access to our Services in the event that (a) you breach these Terms of Service; (b) we are unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide to us; or (c) we believe that your actions may cause financial loss or legal liability for you, our users or us.</p>
            <p><strong>6. Solicited Submission Policy. </strong>Where Organization has specifically invited or requested submission of content within the Services, Organization encourages you to submit content (e.g., updating your directory profile, participation in communities, etc.) to Organization that they have created for consideration in connection with the Services (&quot;User Submissions&quot;). User Submissions remain the intellectual property of the individual user. By posting content on our Service, you expressly grant Organization a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid-up worldwide, fully sub-licensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, transmit, perform and display such content and your name, voice, and/or likeness as contained in your User Submission, in whole or in part, and in any form throughout the world in any media or technology, whether now known or hereafter discovered, including all promotion, advertising, marketing, merchandising, publicity and any other ancillary uses thereof, and including the unfettered right to sublicense such rights, in perpetuity throughout the universe. Any such User Submissions are deemed non-confidential and Organization shall be under no obligation to maintain the confidentiality of any information, in whatever form, contained in any User Submission.</p>
            <p><strong>7. User-Published Content. </strong>User-published Content and User Submissions in the Services do not represent the views of Organization or any individual associated with Organization, and we do not control this Content. In no event shall you represent or suggest, directly or indirectly, Organization&#x27;s endorsement of user-published Content. Organization does not vouch for the accuracy or credibility of any user published Content on our Website or User Submissions published through our Services, and does not take any responsibility or assume any liability for any actions you may take as a result of reviewing any such user-published Content or User Submission. Through your use of the Services, you may be exposed to Content that you may find offensive, objectionable, harmful, inaccurate or deceptive. There may also be risks of dealing with underage persons, people acting under false pretenses, international trade issues, and foreign nationals. By using our Services, you assume all associated risks</p>
            <p><strong>8. Inappropriate User Submissions. </strong>Organization does not encourage and does not seek User Submissions that result from any activity that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal; (ii) may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property; or (iii) may constitute a crime or tort. You agree that you have not and will not engage in any of the foregoing activities in connection with producing your User Submission. Without limiting the foregoing, you agree that in conjunction with your submission, you will not inflict emotional distress on other people, will not humiliate other people (publicly or otherwise), will not assault or threaten other people, will not enter onto private property without permission, will not impersonate any other person or misrepresent your affiliation, title, or authority, and will not otherwise engage in any activity that may result in injury, death, property damage, and/or liability of any kind. Organization will reject any User Submissions in which Organization believes, in its sole discretion, that any such activities have occurred. If notified by a user of a submission that allegedly violates any provision of these Terms of Use, Organization reserves the right to determine, in its sole discretion, if such a violation has occurred, and to remove any such submission from the Service at any time and without notice.</p>
            <p><strong>9. Inappropriate Material. </strong>You are prohibited from using the Services to post or send any unlawful, infringing, threatening, defamatory, libelous, obscene, pornographic or profane material or any material that infringes or misappropriates third-party intellectual property or could constitute or encourage conduct that would be considered a criminal offense or otherwise violate any law. You further agree that sending or posting unsolicited advertisements or &quot;spam&quot; on or through the Services is expressly prohibited by this Agreement. In addition to any remedies that we may have at law or in equity, if we determine, in our sole discretion, that you have violated or are likely to violate the foregoing prohibitions or any applicable rules or policies in these Terms of Service, we may take any action we deem necessary to cure or prevent the violation, including without limitation, banning you from using the Services and/or the immediate removal of the related materials from the Service at any time without notice. We will fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order or subpoena requesting or directing us to disclose the identity of anyone posting such materials.</p>
            <p><strong>10. Right to Takedown Content. </strong>Except as disclosed in our <a href="http://onepercentfortheplanet.org/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>, we will not monitor, edit, or disclose Content posted to the Services unless required in the course of normal maintenance of the Services and its systems or unless required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with the law or comply with legal process served on Organization or the Services; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Organization, the Services, or the users of the Services; or (3) act in an emergency to protect the personal safety of our users, the Services, or the public. Users shall remain solely responsible for the content of their messages while using Services and Organization shall have no obligation to prescreen any such content. However, we shall have the right in our sole discretion to edit, refuse to post or remove any material submitted to or posted on the Services at any time without notice.
